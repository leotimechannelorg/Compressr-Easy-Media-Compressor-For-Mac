# Compressr: Easy Media Compressor For Mac
Compressr™ is an easy media compressor for Mac. It can easily compress .mp3, .wav, .m4a, .mov, or .mp4 files, all without the hassle of other native compressors on Mac. Our compression model uses ffmpeg.

## How to download
Compressr™ is available to download for free on macOS. You can download it from GitHub and also from our [official website](https://sites.google.com/view/compressr). If you download from GitHub, we recommend that you download the .dmg file, as it is more user-friendly to install.

## How to install
If you downloaded the .dmg (the default option), when you open the file you will see a screen where you can drag the Compressr application into your Applications folder. After doing so, go to your Applications folder and open the app. 
MacOS will likely refuse to open the app due to security reasons. If it does so, follow these steps:
1. Open the app.
2. MacOS will likely refuse to open the app. Go to System Settings > Privacy and Security > Scroll all the way down > Open anyway (you will need to enter your password)
3. Start compressing!

## How to use
After opening Compressr, you will be asked to select which files you would like to compress (supported file types are .mp3, .m4a, .wav, .mov, or .mp4), which bitrate you would like to compress too (we recommend 128kbps for saving space but not reducing quality a lot), and the destination folder. Then, click compress to compress the files (this can take some time depending on how many files you are compressing).
